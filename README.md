# 🤖 AI Customer Support Platform

An end-to-end **Agentic AI Customer Support Platform** built with **FastAPI**, **Google Gemini**, **Hybrid RAG**, and **PostgreSQL**.

Instead of relying on a single chatbot prompt, the system follows an **Agent-Oriented Architecture** where an AI planner dynamically decides which tool should solve the user's request.

The platform combines:

- 📚 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Hybrid RAG)
- 🤖 Agentic Tool Calling
- 🗄 PostgreSQL Integration
- 📦 Order Management
- 🎫 Ticket Management
- 📧 Email Generation
- 📊 SQL Analytics
- 📈 Evaluation Framework

---

# ✨ Features

## 🤖 Agent Architecture

The AI agent can reason about a user's request and dynamically choose the appropriate tool.

Available tools:

- Knowledge Search
- Order Lookup
- Ticket Lookup
- SQL Analytics
- Email Generation

---

## 📚 Hybrid RAG Pipeline

The knowledge retrieval system combines multiple retrieval techniques for better accuracy.

Implemented features:

- Hybrid Search (FAISS + BM25)
- Query Rewriting
- Multi Query Retrieval
- Cross Encoder Reranking
- Context Compression
- Retrieval Evaluation

---

## 🗄 Structured Data Support

Structured customer information is stored inside PostgreSQL.

Current entities:

- Orders
- Support Tickets
- Users
- Conversations
- Messages

Database migrations are managed using **Alembic**.

---

## 📊 SQL Analytics Tool

The SQL Tool allows the agent to answer analytical questions over structured data.

Examples:

```
How many shipped orders are there?

Show cancelled orders.

Show open tickets.

List high priority tickets.
```

Instead of allowing arbitrary SQL execution, the system converts supported natural language questions into predefined SQL queries.

---

## 📧 Email Generation

The Email Tool automatically generates customer support emails using the collected conversation context.

---

## 📈 Evaluation Framework

The project includes retrieval evaluation metrics:

- Hit Rate
- Precision
- Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)

and an extensible agent evaluation framework.
